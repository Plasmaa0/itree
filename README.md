This script gets your i3 layout of windows in _**HUMAN READABLE**_ format (not like `i3-save-tree` or `i3-msg -t "get_tree"`)

## Usage
- Clone repo
- Execute `./itree.sh`, nix will do it's thing
- If that didn't work. Requirements:
  - jq
  - bat
  - json2yaml
  - i3
- Anyways the script is simple and you can modify it to work with less req's
